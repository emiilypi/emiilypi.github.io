                            <h2>How Fashion Adapts in the Midst of a Pandemic</h2>
                    
                                <p>Twelfth Street was empty except for Kim Shui. The 29-year-old wore calligraphy-precise black eyeliner and a tiger-print cardigan she designed and sewed herself. She carried a few boxes—a donation of supplies being delivered to local hospitals, plus the last few shipments of clothes she could make before New York City shuts down. “Now what?” she laughed… but there was nobody on the usually packed block to answer her.</p>

                                <p>Instead, the downtown fashion darling beloved by Cardi B. and Kylie Jenner did what resourceful young women have always done when times get tough: She answered the question herself. “I figured it out,” she says from her studio apartment in Manhattan, where she—like millions of other city dwellers—has been ordered to stay home for the foreseeable future. “I’m making masks. I have a sewing machine, and some leftover fabric. I don’t have any elastic,” she say with a sigh, “but I figure I can take it from some of my own clothes for now, and then sew it back on later once I can go shopping for materials again… or even just get to my studio. Obviously, I had to shut it down. My workspace, I mean,” she says firmly. “Not my label. That’s definitely still going.”</p>

                                <p>Style is a lot like love: even when you try, you just can’t stop it. That’s because just like Beyoncé, fashion is a triple threat: it’s a billion-dollar industry, a vital and easily accessible art form, and—because everyone gets dressed in the morning—its goods are both necessary and universal. We all have to have them.</p>

                                <p>But though style is immutable, its influence can certainly get quieter. And with the havoc and heartbreak of COVID-19, the industry is halfway between a pause and a pivot. A 360-view shows both happening now, as independent labels like Christian Siriano and Cynthia Rowley, along with massive corporations like Gap, Coty, and LVMH, are making masks, hospital gowns, and hand sanitizer. Retail shops are shutting down while e-commerce sites are overloading—and in some cases crashing—from so many virtual orders. Face masks (both the N-95 kind and the K-Beauty pore clearers) are in high demand, and sweatpants—once a Seinfeld punchline and a Hype Boi staple—have become so essential, WWD reports sales have spiked 50 percent. At the same time, factory workers and retail employees are losing their jobs, often with no safety net. Stylists, photographers, and makeup and hair artists are currently without income. Textile production has stopped, and many cotton farmers and wool growers can’t plant and harvest.</p>

                                <p>At the core of the luxury sector’s style anxiety is Italy’s fashion scene, a $107.9 billion industry and home to boundary-pushing beacons like Gucci, Prada, Versace, and Beyoncé BFF Peter Dundas, who wrote from his studio with a candid assessment of his challenges right now. “We are set to make masks with our suppliers,” he says, adding, “we are using our own fabrics together with safety-approved fibers, so you can wear something cheerful that helps keep you and others safe. I think everyone is concerned about stocks, cash flow, and what comes next,” he admits, which is why “making uplifting products in a positive environment is really at the top of my list right now.”</p>

                                <p>
                                    Learning about my Blackness began at home — in my living room, seated in front of the television. During primetime, I’d sit with my dad and watch UPN, or as my dad called it, “You People’s Network,” where I’d fall in love with the characters on Eve, Moesha, The Parkers and Girlfriends. Growing up in an urban-suburb, I’d always daydreamed about life in the big city, and watching the characters on these shows transported me there for a few hours each night.

                                <h3>How the Jordan 1 Retro sneaker has Influenced Women's Street Fashion Today</h3>
                                <p>
                                    After almost 20 years of officially operating under the Nike umbrella, Jordan Brand has blossomed into one of the world's leading sportswear brands. Last year, Jordan’s U.S. sales climbed to $2.6 billion, including a 58 percent chunk of the $4.2 billion basketball shoe market. According to Nike CEO Mark Parker, the brand is pushing to be a $4.5 billion business itself by 2020.
