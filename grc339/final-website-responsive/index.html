                  Twelfth Street was empty except for Kim Shui. The 29-year-old wore calligraphy-precise black eyeliner and a tiger-print cardigan she designed and sewed herself. She carried a few boxes—a donation of supplies being delivered to local hospitals, plus the last few shipments of clothes she could make before New York City shuts down. “Now what?” she laughed… but there was nobody on the usually packed block to answer her.

                  Learning about my Blackness began at home — in my living room, seated in front of the television. During primetime, I’d sit with my dad and watch UPN, or as my dad called it, “You People’s Network,” where I’d fall in love with the characters on Eve, Moesha, The Parkers and Girlfriends. Growing up in an urban-suburb, I’d always daydreamed about life in the big city, and watching the characters on these shows transported me there for a few hours each night.

                  After almost 20 years of officially operating under the Nike umbrella, Jordan Brand has blossomed into one of the world's leading sportswear brands. Last year, Jordan’s U.S. sales climbed to $2.6 billion, including a 58 percent chunk of the $4.2 billion basketball shoe market. According to Nike CEO Mark Parker, the brand is pushing to be a $4.5 billion business itself by 2020.
